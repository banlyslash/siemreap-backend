# MVP Scope Limitations

The following features are acknowledged but deferred to future releases:

- Advanced analytics and forecasting
- Mobile app (mobile-responsive web only for MVP)
- Integration with payroll/HRIS systems
- Automated accrual calculations
- Shift swapping functionality
- Multi-level approval workflows
- Document management system
- Custom workflow rules

## Rationale for Limitations

These limitations have been established to:
- Focus on core leave management functionality
- Deliver a working MVP within the 12-week timeline
- Validate the core user journeys before adding complexity
- Ensure a high-quality implementation of essential features
- Allow for user feedback before developing advanced features

## Handling Excluded Features

For features not included in the MVP:
- Manual workarounds will be documented where applicable
- Users will be informed of planned future enhancements
- Feedback mechanisms will be in place to prioritize post-MVP features
- The system architecture will be designed to accommodate these features in future releases
